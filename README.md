# WWF Basic Adventure Game - Match and Player Turn Structure

## 1. Match Structure
The match consists of **three phases**: Pre-Match, Match, and Post-Match.

### 1.1 Pre-Match Phase
1. **Set the Scene**:
   - Role-play introductions, wrestler entrances, and pre-match promos.
   - Use Fan Support, Fan View, or other stats to determine crowd reactions.

2. **Roll Initiative**:
   - Each player rolls initiative (likely d10 or similar).
   - Higher roll goes first; ties are broken by an attribute like Perception.

3. **Determine Starting Positions**:
   - Wrestlers start in designated positions (e.g., corners, center ring).
   - Reference the **Movement Chart** for starting placements.

---

### 1.2 Match Phase (Core Gameplay)
The match progresses in **rounds**, with players alternating **turns** until a pinfall, submission, or other victory condition is achieved.

---

## 2. Player Turn Structure
Each player's turn has **three main steps**: Declare Action, Resolve Action, and End Turn.

### Step 1: Declare Action
The player decides what their wrestler will do on their turn. Options include:

1. **Perform a Maneuver**:
   - Choose a maneuver from the available list.
   - Ensure conditions are met (e.g., attacker's position, defender's position, legality).
   - Reference the **Maneuver List** and positions (Standing, Kneeling, etc.).

2. **Move to a New Position**:
   - Spend **Movement Points** (MOV) to change position (e.g., Apron to Ringside).
   - Use the **Movement Chart** for movement costs.

3. **Attempt a Pinfall, Submission, or Knockout**:
   - **Pinfall**: Roll against opponent's remaining stamina and current stun points.
   - **Submission**: Requires the opponent to be prone and a submission hold applied.
   - **Knockout**: Inflict enough stun damage to exceed their threshold.

4. **Perform a Role-Playing Action**:
   - Taunt the opponent, interact with the crowd, or involve managers/referees.

---

### Step 2: Resolve Action
1. **Roll to Execute**:
   - Roll a d10 or other dice (depending on the maneuver).
   - Apply bonuses or penalties based on attributes, advantages, or modifiers.

2. **Check Success**:
   - Compare the roll against target stats (e.g., opponent's Constitution, Stamina, or Technical Ability).
   - Successful maneuvers deal **Stun Points** or cause positional changes.

3. **Apply Effects**:
   - Record stun damage or other effects on the opponent.
   - Update positions (e.g., attacker moves from Standing to Kneeling).

---

### Step 3: End Turn
1. **Check Recovery**:
   - Roll for recovery (e.g., reduce stun points based on stamina or other modifiers).
   - Reference **Stun and Recovery Rules**.

2. **Pass Turn**:
   - The turn passes to the opponent.
   - Repeat until a round ends.

---

## 3. End of Round
At the end of a round (after all wrestlers have taken their turns):

1. **Referee Actions**:
   - Adjudicate illegal maneuvers or interference.
   - Apply penalties, disqualifications, or match conditions.

2. **Crowd Reactions**:
   - Evaluate Fan Support or View stats based on actions.
   - Apply bonuses for strong crowd reactions.

3. **Continue to Next Round**:
   - Begin the next round unless a victory condition has been met.

---

### 1.3 Post-Match Phase
1. **Resolve Outcomes**:
   - Determine the winner and how they achieved victory (pinfall, submission, knockout, DQ).
   - Update wrestler stats based on match performance.
   - Award experience or money.

2. **Role-Play Post-Match**:
   - Conduct interviews, celebrate victories, or set up rivalries for future matches.

3. **Update Fan Stats**:
   - Adjust Fan Support or Fan View based on the wrestler's performance.
   - Apply bonuses or penalties for particularly memorable moments.

---

## 4. Key Rules to Reference During the Match
- **Movement Chart**: For moving between positions.
- **Maneuver List**: For determining legal moves and requirements.
- **Stun and Recovery Rules**: For managing stamina and damage.
- **Fan Interaction Tables**: For crowd reactions and role-playing elements.
- **Weight Classes and Modifiers**: For resolving certain maneuvers.

---

# Stun Points: A Detailed Explanation

## What Are Stun Points?
Stun Points (STN) represent a wrestler’s ability to endure damage and fatigue during a match. They track how close a wrestler is to being unable to continue the fight. As stun points accumulate, a wrestler becomes more vulnerable to being pinned, submitted, or knocked out.

---

## How Stun Points Are Gained

### 1. **From Maneuvers**
- Each maneuver in the game has a **Stun Points Value** that determines how much stun damage is inflicted on the opponent if the move is successful.
  - Example: A powerful strike might deal `3 Stun Points`, while a basic hold deals `1 Stun Point`.

### 2. **Critical Success**
- If a maneuver roll results in a **critical success** (e.g., rolling the maximum value on a d10), additional stun points may be inflicted based on the maneuver type or wrestler's attributes.

### 3. **Environmental Damage**
- Certain positions or environments (e.g., being thrown into the crowd, hitting the ring post) may add stun points.
  - Reference environmental rules or GM discretion for specific cases.

### 4. **Weight Class Differences**
- If the attacker’s weight class significantly exceeds the defender’s, additional stun points may be applied (e.g., a heavyweight attacking a lightweight).

---

## How Stun Points Are Spent or Used

### 1. **Threshold Effects**
As stun points accumulate, they trigger various thresholds that affect a wrestler’s performance:
- **Minor Stun (1–10 Stun Points)**:
  - No penalties.
- **Moderate Stun (11–20 Stun Points)**:
  - Reduced **Movement Rate** by 1 point.
- **Severe Stun (21–30 Stun Points)**:
  - Wrestler cannot perform **Aerial Maneuvers**.
- **Critical Stun (31+ Stun Points)**:
  - Wrestler becomes highly vulnerable to pins, submissions, or knockouts.

### 2. **Pinfall Attempts**
- Stun Points directly impact a wrestler’s resistance to pinfalls. During a pinfall attempt:
  - The defender rolls against their **remaining stamina** minus their total Stun Points.
  - Higher Stun Points make it harder to kick out.

### 3. **Submission Attempts**
- Similar to pinfall attempts, Stun Points make it harder to resist submissions.
  - The defender’s roll is reduced by the total Stun Points accumulated.

### 4. **Knockouts**
- If a wrestler’s Stun Points exceed a certain threshold (e.g., 50% of their maximum stamina), they are considered **knocked out** and lose the match.

---

## Reducing Stun Points (Recovery)

### 1. **Recovery Roll**
At the end of a wrestler’s turn, they can attempt to recover and reduce their Stun Points:
- Roll a **d6**.
- Add modifiers based on the wrestler’s **Stamina Attribute** and other bonuses.
  - Example: A wrestler with Stamina Level III may add +3 to their recovery roll.
- Subtract any penalties (e.g., from opponent pressure or environmental effects).

### 2. **Maximum Recovery Per Turn**
- Wrestlers can only recover up to a **maximum of 5 Stun Points per turn**, regardless of roll results.

---

## Special Rules for Stun Points

### 1. **Cumulative Damage**
- Stun Points are cumulative throughout the match and do not reset unless specific match rules state otherwise (e.g., in a "Best of Three" match format).

### 2. **Referee Interference**
- If a wrestler accumulates a dangerously high number of Stun Points (e.g., nearing their maximum stamina), the referee may pause the match or end it for safety reasons.

### 3. **Role of Advantages/Disadvantages**
- Certain wrestler advantages (e.g., "Iron Will") or disadvantages (e.g., "Glass Jaw") can modify how stun points are gained or recovered.
  - Example: "Iron Will" reduces Stun Points gained by 1 for every maneuver.

---

## Summary of Stun Point Mechanics

| Action/Event                  | Stun Points Impact                                |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Successful Maneuver           | Adds maneuver’s stun value to the defender.      |
| Environmental Damage          | Adds stun points based on GM discretion.         |
| Recovery Roll                 | Reduces stun points by d6 + stamina modifiers.   |
| Minor Stun (1–10 Points)      | No penalties.                                    |
| Moderate Stun (11–20 Points)  | Movement rate reduced by 1.                      |
| Severe Stun (21–30 Points)    | Aerial moves disabled.                           |
| Critical Stun (31+ Points)    | High risk of pin, submission, or knockout.       |

# Counter Moves: A Detailed Explanation

## What Are Counter Moves?
Counter moves allow a wrestler to defend against an opponent’s maneuver and potentially reverse the situation in their favor. They represent quick thinking, technical skill, and an ability to exploit openings during an opponent’s attack.

---

## When Can a Counter Be Attempted?

1. **During an Opponent’s Maneuver**:
   - A counter move is only available **when the opponent attempts a maneuver** against you.
   - The maneuver being countered must be within the attacker’s current position and match the conditions of the move.
   
2. **Position Restrictions**:
   - Certain maneuvers may not allow for counters (e.g., moves from the top rope or highly technical submissions).
   - Reference the **Maneuver List** for any restrictions on counters.

3. **Attribute Dependency**:
   - A wrestler’s ability to counter a move is influenced by their **Technical Ability (TEC)**, **Perception (PER)**, or other relevant attributes.

---

## How to Resolve a Counter Move

### Step 1: Declare the Counter
- The defending player declares their intent to counter **before the opponent rolls for the maneuver**.
- Ensure the wrestler has the ability to counter (e.g., attribute requirements, position).

### Step 2: Counter Roll
- The defending wrestler rolls a **Counter Check** (usually a d10).
- Apply relevant attribute bonuses (e.g., **Technical Ability Level** or **Perception**).
- Compare the counter roll to the opponent’s maneuver roll.

### Step 3: Determine the Outcome
1. **Successful Counter**:
   - The defender’s counter roll is higher than the attacker’s maneuver roll.
   - The attack fails, and the defender may apply a reversal or take control of the match.
   - Effects:
     - **Reversal**: The defending wrestler may perform a counter maneuver (if applicable).
     - **Interrupt**: The defending wrestler takes the initiative for the next turn.

2. **Failed Counter**:
   - The defender’s counter roll is lower than the attacker’s roll.
   - The attacker’s maneuver succeeds as planned, dealing stun points or causing positional changes.

3. **Tie**:
   - A tied roll may result in a stalemate where neither wrestler gains the upper hand.
   - Alternatively, the referee (or GM) may impose a default result based on the scenario.

---

## Bonuses and Modifiers for Counter Rolls

1. **Technical Ability (TEC)**:
   - Wrestlers with higher Technical Ability gain a bonus to counter rolls.
   - Example: A wrestler with **TEC Level III** might add +2 to their counter roll.

2. **Perception (PER)**:
   - Wrestlers with high Perception may gain an advantage when anticipating moves, adding a bonus to counter rolls.

3. **Advantages**:
   - Certain traits like "Quick Reflexes" or "Master Technician" may provide additional bonuses.
   - Example: "Quick Reflexes" might allow an extra roll in case of failure.

4. **Opponent Disadvantages**:
   - If the attacker has a disadvantage (e.g., "Slow Reaction"), the defender may gain a bonus to their counter roll.

---

## Special Rules for Counter Moves

### 1. Reversal Maneuvers
- If a counter is successful, the defender may perform a specific **reversal maneuver** instead of a regular attack.
- Reversals are listed in the **Maneuver List** and are conditional on the defender’s position and attributes.

### 2. Counter Limits
- Wrestlers may be limited in how many counters they can attempt per round or match.
- Example: A wrestler might only be allowed **one counter attempt per round** unless otherwise stated.

### 3. Positional Changes
- A successful counter may result in a **position change** for both wrestlers.
  - Example: A defender counters an aerial attack, causing the attacker to land prone.

### 4. Critical Success on Counter Roll
- A critical success (e.g., rolling a natural 10) on a counter roll may result in:
  - Automatically reversing the maneuver.
  - Additional stun points applied to the attacker.

---

## Summary Table: Counter Move Outcomes

| Counter Roll Outcome    | Result                                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Defender Roll > Attacker Roll | Counter is successful. Attack is stopped or reversed. |
| Defender Roll < Attacker Roll | Counter fails. Attack proceeds as planned. |
| Defender Roll = Attacker Roll | Stalemate or referee discretion.          |
| Critical Success        | Counter succeeds with additional benefits.    |

---

## Strategic Considerations
- Counter moves are a critical part of defensive play, allowing wrestlers to mitigate damage and regain control of the match.
- Wrestlers with high Technical Ability or Perception are more likely to succeed in countering.
- Players should use counters strategically, as failing a counter leaves them vulnerable to the opponent’s maneuver.

---

# Weight and Weight Modifiers (Weight Mods)

## What is Weight in the Game?
In the WWF Basic Adventure Game, a wrestler’s **weight class** affects their ability to perform maneuvers, resist attacks, and move around the ring. Wrestlers are categorized into **weight classes**, which determine:
- **Strength and lifting limits**
- **Speed and agility**
- **Effectiveness of certain maneuvers**
- **Weight-based modifiers (Weight Mods) for attacks and defenses**

---

## Weight Classes and Their Effects
Each wrestler falls into one of the following **weight classes**, which impacts how they interact with the game mechanics:

| Weight Class    | Typical Weight (lbs) | Effects on Gameplay |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Lightweight    | <200 lbs              | Faster, better at aerial moves but easier to lift. |
| Middleweight   | 200-250 lbs           | Balanced stats, decent power and mobility. |
| Heavyweight    | 250-300 lbs           | Stronger but slower; harder to lift. |
| Super Heavyweight | >300 lbs           | Extremely powerful, difficult to lift, but low agility. |

- **Lightweights and Middleweights** have higher **movement rates** and can execute aerial moves more effectively.
- **Heavyweights and Super Heavyweights** gain bonuses for lifting and striking but may have reduced mobility.

---

## What is Weight Mod (Weight Modifier)?
The **Weight Mod** represents how difficult a wrestler is to lift or throw. This value is used when determining if an opponent can successfully perform certain moves.

- **Higher Weight Mod → Harder to Lift or Move**
- **Lower Weight Mod → Easier to Lift or Move**

### Example Weight Mod Table

| Wrestler's Weight Class | Weight Mod Value |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Lightweight (<200 lbs)  | 8               |
| Middleweight (200-250 lbs) | 12           |
| Heavyweight (250-300 lbs) | 16            |
| Super Heavyweight (>300 lbs) | 20        |

The **Weight Mod** is used in various situations:
1. **Performing Power Moves** – If a wrestler tries to lift an opponent, they must compare their **Brute Strength** against the opponent’s **Weight Mod**.
2. **Aerial and Running Moves** – Lighter wrestlers may receive a bonus to agility-based moves.
3. **Throws and Slams** – A wrestler must have enough strength to execute slams, suplexes, and other power-based moves.

---

## How Weight Mods Affect Maneuvers

### 1. **Lifting an Opponent**
- A wrestler attempting to lift or slam an opponent must have a **Brute Strength** level high enough to overcome the opponent's **Weight Mod**.
- Formula:  
  **Brute Strength Level × 4 ≥ Opponent’s Weight Mod**  
  - If true → Move succeeds.
  - If false → Move fails.

**Example:**
- A wrestler with **Brute Strength Level III** (which equals `3 × 4 = 12`) attempts to lift a **Heavyweight (Weight Mod 16)**.
  - Since **12 < 16**, the move **fails**.
  - The wrestler cannot perform the lift unless they increase their strength.

### 2. **Resisting a Throw or Slam**
- If a wrestler has a **high Weight Mod**, they gain a defensive bonus against being thrown.
- For every **4 points of Weight Mod**, reduce an opponent’s maneuver success roll by `-1`.

**Example:**
- A **Super Heavyweight (Weight Mod 20)** being lifted would impose a **-5 penalty** to the attacker's roll.

### 3. **Impact on Aerial Moves**
- Lighter wrestlers gain bonuses to **Aerial Tactics**, while heavier wrestlers may have penalties.

**Example Modifiers:**
- Lightweights: +2 to aerial maneuvers.
- Heavyweights: -2 to aerial maneuvers.

### 4. **Momentum and Movement**
- Wrestlers with lower Weight Mods can **move faster**, while those with high Weight Mods may have movement restrictions.
- Movement is adjusted as follows:
  - **Lightweights & Middleweights:** No movement penalty.
  - **Heavyweights:** Reduce movement by **1**.
  - **Super Heavyweights:** Reduce movement by **2**.

---

## Summary of Weight and Weight Modifiers

| Effect                        | Lightweights (<200 lbs) | Middleweights (200-250 lbs) | Heavyweights (250-300 lbs) | Super Heavyweights (>300 lbs) |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Weight Mod                     | 8               | 12              | 16              | 20              |
| Bonus to Aerial Moves          | +2              | +1              | -2              | -4              |
| Lift/Throw Difficulty          | Easy            | Moderate        | Hard            | Very Hard       |
| Movement Rate Adjustment       | No change       | No change       | -1              | -2              |
| Power Move Resistance          | None            | None            | -4 to opponent's roll | -5 to opponent's roll |

---

## Strategic Considerations
- **Lightweights** should focus on speed, aerial moves, and agility.
- **Heavyweights & Super Heavyweights** should focus on power moves, slams, and endurance.
- **Middleweights** can be balanced, choosing their strategy based on their opponent.

---

# Critical Rolls: A Detailed Explanation

## What Are Critical Rolls?
A **Critical Roll** occurs when a wrestler achieves an exceptional result on a dice roll, usually by rolling the highest possible value (e.g., a natural 10 on a d10). Critical rolls can significantly impact the match by enhancing maneuver effectiveness, causing unexpected reversals, or triggering special conditions.

---

## When Do Critical Rolls Occur?
Critical rolls typically happen in the following situations:

1. **Maneuver Success Rolls** – When a wrestler rolls a natural 10 while attempting a maneuver.
2. **Counter Rolls** – If a wrestler rolls a natural 10 while countering an opponent’s move.
3. **Recovery Rolls** – A natural 6 on a **recovery roll** may provide extra benefits.
4. **Pinfall or Submission Resistance Rolls** – A natural 10 on a resistance roll may allow an immediate escape.

---

## Effects of a Critical Roll

### **1. Critical Success on Maneuver Rolls**
- If a wrestler rolls a **natural 10** on their maneuver roll, they execute the move **perfectly** and gain additional benefits.
- **Effects of a Critical Success on a Maneuver:**
  - **Increased Stun Points** – The move inflicts **+50% additional stun points** (rounded up).
  - **Automatic Positioning** – The opponent is forced into a **worse position** (e.g., Standing → Kneeling).
  - **Momentum Shift** – The attacking wrestler gains a **+1 bonus to their next maneuver**.

**Example:**
- A wrestler performs a **Powerbomb (Base Stun: 6 Stun Points)** and rolls a **natural 10**.
- With a **Critical Success**, the Powerbomb deals **9 Stun Points** (6 + 50%).
- Additionally, the opponent is immediately forced into a **Prone Position**.

---

### **2. Critical Success on Counter Rolls**
- If a wrestler rolls a **natural 10** on a counter roll, the counter is not only successful, but they gain additional advantages.
- **Effects of a Critical Counter:**
  - **Reversal** – The defender immediately performs a counter-maneuver against the attacker.
  - **Initiative Shift** – The countering wrestler **gains control of the next turn**.
  - **Opponent Staggered** – The attacker takes **+2 Stun Points** due to being caught off-guard.

**Example:**
- An opponent attempts a **Running Clothesline**.
- The defending wrestler rolls a **natural 10** on their counter roll.
- Instead of just blocking, they immediately perform a **Back Body Drop**, putting the attacker in a **Prone Position**.

---

### **3. Critical Success on Recovery Rolls**
- If a wrestler rolls a **natural 6** on a **Recovery Roll**, they regain additional stamina and may take an extra action.
- **Effects of a Critical Recovery:**
  - **Extra Stun Points Recovered** – Recover **+2 additional Stun Points**.
  - **Bonus Movement** – Wrestler can **move 1 additional space** on the **Movement Chart**.

**Example:**
- A wrestler attempts to recover from a **Severe Stun** (23 Stun Points).
- They roll a **6** on their recovery roll, allowing them to recover **8 Stun Points** instead of 6.

---

### **4. Critical Success on Pinfall or Submission Resistance**
- If a wrestler rolls a **natural 10** while resisting a pinfall or submission, they immediately break free.
- **Effects of a Critical Resistance:**
  - **Immediate Escape** – The pin or submission attempt fails instantly.
  - **Momentum Shift** – The defender **gains initiative** next turn.
  - **Attacker Knocked Off-Balance** – The attacking wrestler loses any positional advantage.

**Example:**
- A wrestler is trapped in a **Sharpshooter Submission** and must roll to resist.
- They roll a **natural 10**, breaking free immediately and knocking the attacker off balance.

---

## Critical Failure (Rolling a Natural 1)
Just as a **natural 10** results in a **Critical Success**, rolling a **natural 1** often leads to a **Critical Failure**.

### **1. Critical Failure on Maneuver Rolls**
- If a wrestler rolls a **natural 1** while attempting a maneuver:
  - **The move fails completely.**
  - The wrestler may lose their balance, moving to a **worse position**.
  - If an aerial maneuver fails, the attacker **takes 2 Stun Points** from a bad landing.

**Example:**
- A wrestler attempts a **Flying Dropkick** but rolls a **natural 1**.
- They miss completely, fall to the mat, and take **2 Stun Points**.

### **2. Critical Failure on Counter Rolls**
- If a wrestler rolls a **natural 1** on a counter attempt:
  - The counter fails **dramatically**.
  - The opponent **automatically succeeds** with their move.
  - The defender takes **+2 extra Stun Points** due to being caught off-guard.

### **3. Critical Failure on Recovery Rolls**
- Rolling a **natural 1** on a recovery attempt results in:
  - **No Stun Points recovered.**
  - **Loss of next movement action** (wrestler is too dazed to move).

**Example:**
- A wrestler attempts to recover and rolls a **natural 1**.
- They remain stunned, and their movement is **skipped on the next turn**.

---

## Summary of Critical Rolls

| Roll Type | Natural 10 (Critical Success) | Natural 1 (Critical Failure) |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Maneuver Roll** | +50% Stun Points, forced positioning, momentum gain | Move fails, attacker loses balance, possible self-damage |
| **Counter Roll** | Reversal, initiative shift, attacker staggered | Counter fails, opponent automatically succeeds, +2 Stun Points |
| **Recovery Roll** | +2 extra Stun Points recovered, bonus movement | No recovery, lose movement action next turn |
| **Pinfall/Submission Resistance** | Immediate escape, initiative shift | No special penalty |

---

## Strategic Considerations
- **Aggressive players** may take risks on high-difficulty maneuvers in hopes of landing a **critical success**.
- **Technical wrestlers** with strong counters benefit greatly from rolling **natural 10s** in defensive situations.
- **Managing risk** is important—failing an aerial move or counter can leave a wrestler in a **dangerous position**.
